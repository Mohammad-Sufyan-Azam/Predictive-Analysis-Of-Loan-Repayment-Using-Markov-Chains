# Predictive-Analysis-Of-Loan-Repayment-Using-Markov-Chains

## Abstract
The due dates on the loans issued by banks are always among the most significant crisis in the evolution of loan lenders toward clients. The higher the loan amount is, the more significant damage will be done if the repayment is not completed.
Banks can avoid suffering from capital losses by appropriately estimating their future costs and adopting choices like determining their surplus budget and conserving their confidence. In this study, we looked into the predictive modelling of client loan repayment patterns by a discrete time markov chain.


## Objectives
+ Model a markov chain to classify loan states and find out loan repayment probability.
+ Check whether it satisfies all the Markov Chain's propoerties or not.
+ Define the nature of the Markov Chain.
+ Plot the probability matrix of staying in a particular state after 10000 iterations.
+ Plot the probability matrix of generating risk vs paid loans probability.
